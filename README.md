### Hi there, my name is Teresa 👩🏻‍💻

I am a curious, versatile and determined front-end developer, used to work in multicultural environments and in different languages.

Attempting to improve my knowledge in Digital Marketing, I discovered a new passion, a new way of combining my creative and analytical skills: programming.

Working internationally, in multidisciplinary teams and in different types of business, made me become an adaptable, empathetic and fast-learner person.

🎨 Passionate about painting.
